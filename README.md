# Casio calculator programmes for heat transfer models
These might come in handy for anyone who has a heat transfer exam coming up. The equations used in this area of knowledge tend to be more based on models rather than fundamental physical laws, so they end up being a pain to type on a calculator. The posted programmes here all calculate the Nusselt number (Nu) in a variety of situations.

The equations posted here are:
- 2CHIL-CO: Chilton and Colburn - an external mixed flow (i.e. both laminar and turbulent) slides on a horizontal plane (0.6<Pr<60, ReL<10^8)
- 2WITAKER: Witaker - an external mixed flow (i.e. both laminar and turbulent) slides on a horizontal plane (0.7<Pr<400, ReL<3.10^7)
- 3CHU-BER: Churchil and Bernstein - an external flow hits perpendicularly to an isothermal cylinder (Pr>0.5)
- 7GNIELIN: Gnielinski - internal turbulent flow (0.5<Pr<2000, 3000<Re<5.10^6)
- 89CHUCHU: Churchil and Chu - an external flow is created on a vertical wall due to natural convection

Once calculated, the Nusselt number is stored in the N variable.
